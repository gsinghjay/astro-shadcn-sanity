# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Epic Status Transitions:
#   - backlog → in-progress: Automatically when first story is created (via create-story)
#   - in-progress → done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created in stories folder
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Ready for code review (via Dev's code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically creates next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)
#
# CHANGE LOG:
# ===========
# 2026-02-07: Sprint Change Proposal approved

#   - Story 1.3 added (was 1.2): schema-infrastructure (renumbered)
#   - Story 1.4 replaced: mobile-navigation-and-breadcrumbs → storybook-setup
#   - Original 1.3 (layout/header/footer) absorbed into 1.2 migration
#   - Original 1.4 (mobile-nav/breadcrumbs) absorbed into 1.2 migration
#   - Epic 2 refocused: block schemas + Sanity integration (frontend from migration)
#   - Story 2.1 replaced: core-block-schemas (combines original 2.1-2.4 schema work)
#   - Story 2.2 replaced: groq-queries-and-page-data-fetching (new)
#   - Story 2.3 retained: page-composition-system
#   - Story 2.4 removed: absorbed into 2.1
#   - Epics 3-4 compressed: schema/GROQ focus only (frontend already migrated)
#   - Block naming: architecture camelCase names retained (heroBanner, ctaBanner, etc.)
#   - P0 blocks promoted: statsRow, textWithImage, teamGrid moved from P1 to P0
