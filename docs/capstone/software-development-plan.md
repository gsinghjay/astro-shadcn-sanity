## Phase Descriptions

### 1. Scope

Define the boundaries, objectives, and high-level requirements of the software project.

### 2. Analysis / Software Requirements

Gather, analyze, and document detailed software requirements. Identify functional and non-functional requirements.

### 3. Design

Create the system architecture, database design, user interface mockups, and detailed technical specifications.

### 4. Development

Implement the software based on the design specifications. Write, integrate, and review code.

### 5. Testing

Execute test plans including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing. Identify and resolve defects.

### 6. Training

Prepare training materials and conduct training sessions for end users and support staff.

### 7. Documentation

Produce user manuals, technical documentation, API documentation, and operational guides.

### 8. Pilot

Deploy the software to a limited user group for real-world validation before full rollout.

### 9. Deployment

Roll out the software to the production environment for all users.

### 10. Post Implementation

Monitor system performance, gather user feedback, address issues, and transition to ongoing maintenance.
